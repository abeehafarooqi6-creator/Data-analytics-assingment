This project focuses on basic data preprocessing and data analysis using Python. The objective of the assignment is to understand how to work with real-world datasets by cleaning data, handling missing values, creating simple visualizations, and performing basic analytical queries.

The dataset used in this project is a Kindle Books dataset obtained from Kaggle. It contains information about books such as title, author, price, number of pages, publisher, language, and customer-related details. Since real-world datasets often contain missing and inconsistent values, the initial step involved identifying null values across all columns.

To improve data quality, rows with missing values in essential columns such as title and author were removed. Missing values in other columns were handled using appropriate statistical methods, including mean for numerical data, median for numerical data with possible outliers, and mode for categorical data.

For data visualization, two basic charts were created. A box plot was used to visualize the distribution of book prices and to identify outliers. A bar chart was created for a categorical column to show the frequency of records across different categories. These visualizations help in understanding the structure and spread of the data in a simple and intuitive way.

In the data analysis section, basic analytical operations were performed. These included calculating the average of a numerical column, sorting the dataset in descending order based on price, displaying the correlation between numerical columns, and filtering records based on categorical values. These operations provide meaningful insights into pricing trends and data relationships.

Overall, this project demonstrates fundamental data analytics skills such as data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. It serves as a beginner-level introduction to practical data analysis workflows.
